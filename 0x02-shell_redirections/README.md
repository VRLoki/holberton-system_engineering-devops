# 0x02 - Shell, redirections

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What do the commands `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, and `tr` do
* How to redirect outputs and inputs
* How to combine commands and filters with redirections
* How to add special characters and what are they
* How to display a line of text
* How to manipulate strings
* What are the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files
