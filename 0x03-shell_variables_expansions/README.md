# 0x03 - Shell, init files, variables and expansions

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What happens when I type `$ ls -l *.txt`
* What are the /etc/profile file and the /etc/profiled directory
* What is the ~/.bashrc file
* The difference between a local and a global variable
* How to manipulate variables
* What are special parameters
* The difference between single and double quotes
* The alias command
