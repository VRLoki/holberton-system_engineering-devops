# 0x01 - Shell, permissions

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What do the commands `chmod`, `sudo`, `su`, `chown`, `chgrp` do
* Know how works the global Linux files permissions
* How to run a command with root privileges
* How to manage users and groups
